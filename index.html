            <p>Without a doubt, spring water is the winner. It is considered the best water to drink, providing vital
                nutrients as it moves through the body. This is, of course, spring water that is bottled at the source
                and proven to be actual living spring water.</p>

            <h3>Alkaline</h3>
            <img src="Alk.jpg" />
            <p>Alkaline water has a higher pH level than that of plain tap water. So proponents say that it can
                neutralize acid in your bloodstream. Some say that alkaline water can help prevent disease, such as
                cancer and heart disease. However, more research is needed to verify these claims.</p>

            <h3>Hydration</h3>
            <img src="Dehydration.jpg" />
            <p>Dehydration is caused by not drinking enough fluid or by losing more fluid than you take in. Fluid is
                lost through sweat, tears, vomiting, urine or diarrhoea. The severity of dehydration can depend on a
                number of factors, such as climate, level of physical activity and diet.</p>
